Wash and organize baby clothes: Launder and organize baby clothes, blankets, and other fabric items before your baby arrives. Sort them by size and keep them easily accessible.
Baby-proofing: Ensure that your home is safe for a newborn by baby-proofing rooms and removing potential hazards such as sharp objects, choking hazards, or unstable furniture.</li>

          <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Baby Essentials:</span>  Make a checklist: Create a list of essential items your baby will need, including diapers, wipes, clothing, swaddling blankets, bottles or breastfeeding supplies, a baby bathtub, and a thermometer.
Purchase or borrow items: Begin acquiring the necessary items by purchasing them yourself or borrowing from friends or family. Consider for a baby shower to receive gifts that can help you meet your baby's needs.</li>

Understand the length of leave you are entitled to, whether it is paid or unpaid, and the process for notifying your employer and applying for leave.
Plan for your absence: Coordinate with your supervisor or colleagues to ensure a smooth transition during your absence. Delegate tasks, create handover documents, and provide clear instructions for your temporary replacement.</li>
          

<li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Childcare Options:</span>Research available options: Explore different childcare options that align with your preferences and needs. This may include daycare centers, in-home care providers, or hiring a nanny. Consider factors such as cost, location, hours of operation, and reputation.
Visit and interview potential providers: Schedule visits to childcare facilities or arrange interviews with potential caregivers. Ask about their qualifications, daily routines, safety measures, and policies on feeding, napping, and playtime.</li>
