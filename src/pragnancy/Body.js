              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Pay attention to your health:</span> Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial, especially when you're pregnant and responsible for both your well-being and your baby's. Prioritize your health by ensuring you're receiving an adequate amount of folic acid, incorporating a prenatal vitamin into your routine (as suggested by your healthcare provider), following a nutritious pregnancy diet, considering safe exercise options suitable for pregnancy, and making sleep a priority.</li>
    
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Avoid pregnancy no-nos:</span>  While it's important not to isolate oneself excessively, it's crucial to be cautious during pregnancy as certain factors can be harmful. These include specific foods, alcohol, tobacco smoke, excessive caffeine, certain medications, recreational drugs such as marijuana, various toxins, as well as specific activities and behaviors. Consulting with a healthcare provider is essential to gain personalized guidance on what precautions to take.</li>
    
    
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Be prepared for early pregnancy symptoms:</span>Pregnancy symptoms can vary from woman to woman, so it's important to be prepared and informed to avoid unexpected surprises. Some common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue, unusual food cravings, breast soreness, and frequent bathroom visits. However, there are numerous other symptoms that may arise as well. Educating yourself about these potential experiences can help you navigate your pregnancy more smoothly.</li>
    
    
    <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Brace yourself for body changes:</span>While you may anticipate the obvious physical changes like a growing belly and enlarged breasts, pregnancy brings about various other body transformations that might catch you by surprise. Look out for thicker hair, darkened skin, and increased acne during earlier stages, and later on, swollen ankles, stretch marks, and varicose veins. Additionally, there could be other alterations in your body and appearance. It's important to remember that every woman experiences pregnancy differently, but being aware of potential changes can help you embrace and adapt to your unique physical transformation.</li>
              
    
    <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Follow your baby's development:</span>As your pregnancy progresses, your baby undergoes rapid growth and development. Monitoring your baby's weekly progress can be a source of joy and motivation, especially during times when you may be experiencing uncomfortable pregnancy symptoms. Keeping track of your baby's development can help uplift your spirits and provide a sense of anticipation and connection throughout your pregnancy journey.</li>
