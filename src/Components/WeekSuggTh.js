    <h3>You are in Third Trimester (Weeks 28 to 40)</h3>

    <div className='basic-main'>
      <p className='para-p'>While you may be pregnant for the entirety of the third trimester, the majority of expectant parents go into labor between week 37 and week 39, with the rest going earlier or as late as 42 weeks. About half of twin pregnancies deliver before 37 weeks.</p>

      <p className='para-p'>WThe third trimester may be your hardest as you adjust to the emotional changes of birth and parenthood</p>

      
    
      
      <h4>Symptoms</h4>
      <div className="wtd-img my">
        <img src = 'img/third-t.png'/>
      </div>
      <p className='para-p'>At the start of your third trimester, you’ve likely gained between 17 and 24 pounds. This steady uptick of the scale continues for about two more months. Then, around week 37, your total weight gain will likely hold steady between 25 and 35 pounds.</p>

      <p className='para-p'>The increase of total weight, plus the fact that your belly is pulling your spine forward, can amplify back pain. Meanwhile, your crowded and ballooning uterus is putting pressure inside your abdomen, possibly spurring hemorrhoids.</p>

      <p className='para-p'>Your uterus is also likely pressing on your diaphragm, hindering breathing and increasing heartburn. At the same time, your lungs and intestines have also shifted positions in order to accommodate your growing baby.</p>

        <h4>What to Expect</h4>
        <p className='para-p'>It's true that your second trimester likely has you feeling better than the first, but it's not exactly symptom-free. For instance, as your trimester nears its end, you may start to feel practice uterine contractions, called Braxton Hicks.</p>
        <p className='para-p'>IHormones continue to flow, and your baby steadily grows, taking up more and more room (and forcing your body to accommodate).</p>
        <p className='para-p'>IWhile every person's pregnancy is different, here are some not-so-welcome pregnancy side effects you may be faced with during your second trimester:</p>
        <ul className='basic-ul'>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>New baby positioning:</span> All of this can cause aches, ouches, and disrupted sleep. However, midway through your final trimester, you may experience some relief by way of lightening, a term used for when your baby drops lower into the birth canal. Unfortunately, baby's downward shift then increases pressure on your bladder</li>
    
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Subtle body changes:</span>  As you inch closer and closer to delivery day, you'll notice subtle changes in your body. For instance, Braxton Hicks contractions may occur more frequently now. And around week 31, your breasts may begin to leak a creamy yellow or a thin, watery substance called colostrum.</li>

              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Hormone changes:</span> In addition, your body is now churning out the hormone relaxin, which loosens the ligaments and bones in your pelvis, allowing for baby to exit smoothly—and also spurring late-in-pregnancy clumsiness. Your estrogen levels are increasing in order to soften (efface) and open (dilate) your cervix. As a result, your mucus plug, which has been shielding your cervix from bacteria, begins to thin.</li>

              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>More visits to the doctor:</span>  All the while, your healthcare provider will be keeping close tabs on both you and your baby. Come the third trimester, prenatal appointments shift from once every four weeks to twice a month. Then, around week 36, you'll begin to see your physician or midwife every week.</li>

              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>The grand finale:</span> And, of course, the grand finale of the third trimester is labor and delivery. You'll know when labor kicks in when you begin to experience real contractions.</li>
          </ul>


          <h4>Your Baby's Development</h4>
          <div className="wtd-img jjk">
        <img src = 'img/third.png'/>
      </div>
          <p className='para-p'>While you're going through all of these major changes leading up to delivery day, so is your baby. This is a time of accelerated growth and finishing-touches development. Your baby will have gained roughly 5 pounds in the 12 weeks that make up this final trimester, starting at just over 2 pounds and being born at roughly 7 pounds..</p>

<p className='para-p'>
At the end of the first trimester, your baby has already reached a length of more than 3 inches and has developed essential features. It now has arms, legs, eyes, and a beating heart. All of the baby's organs, muscles, limbs, and even genitals are already formed at this stage. However, it's important to note that you won't be able to determine the sex of your baby until around week 20 of your pregnancy.
</p>

<p className='para-p'>DUp until the third trimester, the surface of your baby-to-be's brain was nearly smooth. Now, thanks to developing brain tissue, it's filled with grooves and folds. And it continues maturing throughout this trimester, growing by a third between week 35 and week 39.</p>

<p className='para-p'>Baby's lung and liver are steadily developing during these later weeks, too. Since the brain, liver, and lungs need one more week to mature, your baby is considered “early term” if born between week 37 and week 38</p>

<p className='para-p'>By week 39, your baby is fully developed and physically ready for birth.</p>

<p className='para-p'>Finally, baby's bones are fully formed, but the plates in the baby’s skull remain malleable in order for your baby to pass through the birth canal with ease. By week 39, your baby will not become any more physically ready for birth. Instead, they use this time to properly position themselves for labor.</p>



<h4>Helpful Tips</h4>
          <ul className='basic-ul'>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Enjoy the fun! :</span>  This trimester may be the most challenging, but it's also filled with exciting milestones. When your partner places their hand on your belly, they can now feel your baby move from the outside. And there's a lot to feel since baby's movements are more frequent now.</li>
    
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}></span>  Soon, you'll actually be able to see baby's kicks and flutters through your belly, too. For many parents-to-be, this is also when the shower is thrown, the nursery is put in order, and nesting kicks in.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Labor and Delivery</h4>
          <p className="para-p">If everything goes according to plan, you will deliver at around 40 weeks, though many expectant parents do so before or after. Your delivery may follow your birth plan to the letter or look entirely different than you have imagined it, perhaps, ending in a C-section when you intended to have a vaginal birth.</p>
          <p className="para-p">Regardless, your body (if not your mind) has been preparing for this moment throughout the course of your pregnancy. Take comfort that you have selected a healthcare practitioner that you can count on, lean on your support team, and communicate your wishes for pain management and more.</p>

          <p className="para-p">Reading more about the final weeks of pregnancy in this guide can help you better understand different labor and delivery scenarios and what you can expect, both during and after.</p>

          <p className="para-p">This day may seem forever away, but it will be here before you know it. And what may have sometimes seemed like the long road you took to get there will be all worth it.</p>
