      <h3>You are in Second Trimester (Weeks 14 to 27)</h3>

      <div className='basic-main'>
        <p className='para-p'>TFor most parents-to-be, the middle trimester is considered the easiest. The reason: Your newly-formed placenta is generating more progesterone, a hormone needed to keep your uterine lining baby-friendly.</p>
       
        <h4>Symptoms</h4>

      </div>
        <p className='para-p'>This progesterone-boost coincides with a decrease in the production of symptom-causing hCG. As such, you may feel like your pre-pregnancy self again, enjoying an uptick of energy and appetite.</p>
        <p className='para-p'>Regardless of your appetite, most people can expect to gain about one pound a week during the second trimester, putting total weight gain at about 12 to 14 pounds by the end of week 27.</p>
        <p className='para-p'>The second trimester is considered the easiest due to a progesterone boost that creates an increase in energy and appetite.</p>
          <h4>What to Expect</h4>
          <p className='para-p'>It's true that your second trimester likely has you feeling better than the first, but it's not exactly symptom-free. For instance, as your trimester nears its end, you may start to feel practice uterine contractions, called Braxton Hicks.</p>
          <p className='para-p'>IHormones continue to flow, and your baby steadily grows, taking up more and more room (and forcing your body to accommodate).</p>
          <p className='para-p'>IWhile every person's pregnancy is different, here are some not-so-welcome pregnancy side effects you may be faced with during your second trimester:</p>
          
          <ul className='basic-ul'>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}></span> Frequent urination</li>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}></span> Back pain; sciatic nerve pain</li>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}></span>Low blood pressure</li>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}></span> Leg cramps</li>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}></span> Round ligament pain (This involves ligaments that stretch from the top of your uterus to either side of your pelvis.)</li>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}></span> Racing heart</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Your Baby's Development</h4>
          <div className="wtd-img jjk">
        <img src = 'img/second.png'/>
      </div>
          <p className='para-p'>WRegardless of how you are feeling, there's a lot happening with your baby during this time. They kick off your second trimester at a mere one ounce and closes it out at 2¼ pounds. Your baby will also grow more than 10 inches, measuring 13¾ inches long by end of this trimester.</p>

<p className='para-p'>
At the end of the first trimester, your baby has already reached a length of more than 3 inches and has developed essential features. It now has arms, legs, eyes, and a beating heart. All of the baby's organs, muscles, limbs, and even genitals are already formed at this stage. However, it's important to note that you won't be able to determine the sex of your baby until around week 20 of your pregnancy.
</p>

<p className='para-p'>During this period of tremendous growth, your baby-to-be's liver, spleen, and thyroid all begin to take on their respective responsibilities. Baby's brain and nerve endings are mature enough that they can now feel touch. Their soft and flexible skeleton begins to ossify, or harden.</p>
<p className='para-p'>By roughly week 22, a tiny heartbeat can actually be heard if your partner puts their ear to your abdomen—perhaps some hiccups, too—since your baby is busily swallowing amniotic fluid now.At the same time, the baby's auditory system is developed enough that they may be able to hear from you, too.</p>

<p className='para-p'>About halfway through your second trimester, you'll experience many milestone moments. The baby bump you've been anticipating will probably become visible to others around week 20. (Maternity clothes are now in full rotation.).</p>

<p className='para-p'>Around that time, you'll also start to feel your baby's first movements. (You may show—and feel movement—a couple of weeks earlier if this is not your first child.) Around week 18 to week 20, you'll have the choice to learn your baby's sex, when baby-to-be's genitals become detectable on an ultrasound.</p>

<p className='para-p'>By the end of your second trimester, your baby looks a lot like the person you will meet at week 40, albeit much smaller and more wrinkly. Baby's eyes and ears have moved to their intended location and their arms and legs are now proportionate to rest of the body. And, perhaps most exciting, you'll be able to see your baby-to-be during this trimester, thanks to an ultrasound taken around week 20.</p>

              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Share the news:</span>  Your chance of miscarriage drops to between 1 percent and 5 percent in the second trimester, according to the March of Dimes.5 Armed with that knowledge, many parents-to-be now decide to share their big news with a wider circle.</li>
    
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Plan ahead:</span>  During the first trimester of pregnancy, it is not necessary for every pregnant individual to have a first-trimester ultrasound. While some may eagerly anticipate seeing a sonogram image of their growing baby, the timing of the ultrasound can vary. Typically, the first-trimester ultrasound is performed to confirm the pregnancy's viability, determine the gestational age, and identify any potential issues or abnormalities. However, healthcare providers may have different approaches regarding when to conduct the ultrasound. Most individuals will likely have their first opportunity to see their baby's picture during the second trimester, around 18-20 weeks, during the comprehensive anatomy scan. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider to understand their specific recommendations for ultrasound timing. Rest assured that your baby is developing rapidly during the first trimester, even without an early ultrasound, and regular prenatal care will ensure appropriate monitoring and support throughout your pregnancy.</li>
