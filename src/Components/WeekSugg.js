      <h3>You are in First Trimester (Weeks 1 to 13)</h3>

      <div className='basic-main'>
        <p className='para-p'>The first trimester of pregnancy, despite spanning three months, is often considered the shortest trimester due to a specific reason. During the first month, many individuals may not even be aware that they are pregnant. Home pregnancy tests typically do not yield a positive result until around week 4 of pregnancy. As a result, the time during which one is unaware of their pregnancy contributes to the perception that the first trimester is relatively short compared to the other two trimesters.</p>
        <p className='para-p'>The first trimester is considered the shortest since it takes about 4 weeks for many people to realize they're pregnant.</p>
        <p className='para-p'>Moreover, week 1 and week 2 are actually the weeks you ovulate and have your menstrual period. So, while the duration of pregnancy consists of 40 weeks, the countdown starts roughly two weeks before you officially become pregnant. (Confusing, we know.)</p>
        <h4>Symptoms</h4>

      </div>
        <p className='para-p'>Your noticeable baby bump typically doesn't appear until the second trimester of pregnancy. However, there are other outward signs of pregnancy that you may experience before that time. For example, you may notice swollen breasts and changes in your skin.
During the first trimester, any changes in your belly are often attributed to bloating and increased gas, rather than actual baby growth. However, by the end of the first trimester, it's common to gain some weight. On average, individuals may gain between 1 and 4½ pounds during this period. Keep in mind that weight gain can vary among individuals, and it's important to discuss weight changes and pregnancy-related concerns with your healthcare provider.</p>
          <h4>What to Expect</h4>
          <ul className='basic-ul'>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Early symptoms:</span> The pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is coursing through your body, doubling every two to three days and peaking at week 10. It's produced by cells in your growing placenta and spurs the release of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. All of this contributes to a myriad of possible (but not guaranteed) early pregnancy symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, and heartburn. These symptoms tend to wane come your second trimester when hCG levels off</li>
    
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Prenatal appointments:</span>  You'll begin your prenatal appointments this trimester, of course, so it's important that you have a practitioner you are confident in and comfortable with. There's no rule that states that the provider who has been giving you your annual check-ups and Pap smears needs to be the one you see throughout pregnancy.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Your Baby's Development</h4>
          <div className="wtd-img jjk">
        <img src = 'img/first.png'/>
      </div>
          <p className='para-p'>While your first trimester doesn't yield much in the way of outward physical changes, a lot is happening that cannot be seen.

Day one of your pregnancy, the sperm and egg have yet to meet. By week 6—halfway through your first trimester—your baby's tiny face, skull, and brain start to form. Their hands and feet make their bud-like debut on baby's tadpole-esque body.
</p>

<p className='para-p'>
At the end of the first trimester, your baby has already reached a length of more than 3 inches and has developed essential features. It now has arms, legs, eyes, and a beating heart. All of the baby's organs, muscles, limbs, and even genitals are already formed at this stage. However, it's important to note that you won't be able to determine the sex of your baby until around week 20 of your pregnancy.
</p>

<p className='para-p'>Your baby's circulatory and urinary systems are functioning; the baby's skeleton begins the slow process of calcifying; their bone marrow is producing white blood cells, and your baby's vocal cords are progressing toward maturity.</p>

<h4>Helpful Tips</h4>
          <ul className='basic-ul'>
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Start looking for a healthcare provider:</span>  If you haven't done so already, now is a good time to research and understand the distinction between OB/GYNs (obstetrician-gynecologists) and midwives. It can be helpful to seek recommendations from friends and family members regarding these healthcare providers. Once you have made a decision, you can anticipate having appointments with your chosen practitioner every four weeks until the end of your second trimester. After that point, the frequency of your visits will likely increase.</li>
    
              <li><span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Don't schedule an ultrasound just yet:</span>  During the first trimester of pregnancy, it is not necessary for every pregnant individual to have a first-trimester ultrasound. While some may eagerly anticipate seeing a sonogram image of their growing baby, the timing of the ultrasound can vary. Typically, the first-trimester ultrasound is performed to confirm the pregnancy's viability, determine the gestational age, and identify any potential issues or abnormalities. However, healthcare providers may have different approaches regarding when to conduct the ultrasound. Most individuals will likely have their first opportunity to see their baby's picture during the second trimester, around 18-20 weeks, during the comprehensive anatomy scan. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider to understand their specific recommendations for ultrasound timing. Rest assured that your baby is developing rapidly during the first trimester, even without an early ultrasound, and regular prenatal care will ensure appropriate monitoring and support throughout your pregnancy.</li>
